Whether you’re in your first year of coding or tenth, you’ve probably heard of the term “open source”. If you don’t know the definition, I think [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/) summarizes it perfectly:

> _Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance._

No black box here! Open source software is literally accessible for anyone to add their input to. This is great since users can help shape what they would like to see in the program themselves. They can test, discuss new features which will in time evolve the software into something better than it was before.

Showing that you contribute to open source shows possible employers that you can work well with other programmers. Communication is key when pull requests (PRs) are reviewed and future enhancements are discussed. This kind of developer would be a welcome part to any team.

I for one like to break from my projects when I’m stuck or just want to code but not on my own creations. I feel good after submitting a pull request.

You always need to remember that there is someone else out there that is going to know less than you. Use your knowledge to help someone else.


My first experience in open source was during [Hacktoberfest in 2018](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). I saw the event mentioned in Quincy Larson's (creator of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which is also open source) email and decided to see what it was all about.

Hacktoberfest encourages developers (aimed for newbies) to make at least 5 PRs in October. You sign up using your GitHub profile and it tracks your data and how many PRs you’ve made. I was able to get a t-shirt and some awesome stickers from the event.

Many of my contributions were for FreeCodeCamp since I wasn’t familiar with other projects at the time.

Since then, I've contributed to [dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl) and [Gridsome](https://github.com/gridsome). I also like to casually check out other repos through lists on (link github and other ones I’ve bookmarked). I even have an “Open Source Issues” folder in my bookmarks when I don’t have time to look up new projects.

You don’t need to understand the code to contribute, documentation fixes/additions is always encouraged. Making PRs simply helping with markdown was all it took for me to be offered an invitation to join the organization in charge of the software.

I'm going to leave you with some useful links to help get you started into open source:

Being a part of the open source community isn’t something you need to spend a lot of time on. It can take days, even weeks, to figure out just where one function is being done in the code, let alone how the whole thing ticks. Be patient with the code, and with yourself. You will get it.
