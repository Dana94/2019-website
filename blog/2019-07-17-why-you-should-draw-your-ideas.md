I find it incredibly satisfying to have my project ideas written down. Whether it be a sketchbook or imple notebook paper, you will have more clarity to see what you're trying to do.

Before I continue, I just need to point out to whoever is rading this and says 

_I can't draw! My stuff will look horrible!_ 

It's fine, unless you want to show them off, no one else needs to see your ideas on paper.

Since I work in front-end, I enjoy drawing out my ideas in a sketchbook specifically for my coding projects.
