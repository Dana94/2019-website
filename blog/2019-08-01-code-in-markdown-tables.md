> A note about writing code in markdown tables.

I came across a issue with a line of code not formatted properly in a README.md today and wanted to make a note in case someone else had the same problem to Google.

# Grid table

## Basic example

+-------+----------+------+
| Table Headings   | Here |
+-------+----------+------+
| Sub   | Headings | Too  |
+=======+==========+======+
| cell  | column spanning |
+ spans +----------+------+
| rows  | normal   | cell |
+-------+----------+------+
| multi | cells can be    |
| line  | *formatted*     |
|       | **paragraphs**  |
| cells |                 |
| too   |                 |
+-------+-----------------+
