I encourage every programmer to read Coders by Clive Thompson. This book captures how coders were first introduced to technology, then into a vast range of occupations, and how we got to where we are now.

I had to split this review into 2 parts because there is a lot I wanted to emphasize.

## 10X programmers 
> "This belief in the unicorn programmer isn’t just a piece of pop culture. Indeed, in the real world of software, it’s so well known that the concept has a name: the “10X” coder. As the moniker suggests, it describes a programmer who is provably better, multiple times so, than the average code monkey." (pg. 150-151)

I have many thoughts about the sought-after programmer that fits the title of a “unicorn”. For one, I don’t believe it’s fair to demote everyone to the term “code monkey” if you don’t fit this criteria. It’s an insult to all the different knowledge coders have gained through their experiences on their own journey. 

I learned of the term “10X” coder for the first time when reading this book. Coincidentally, it was the around the same time this [Twitter post came out](https://twitter.com/skirani/status/1149302834619248640) where someone encouraged startups to hire as many “10X” coders as they can. The post suggested ways to point out these needed developers by identifying those who “hate meetings”, are “poor mentors” and other traits that may be seen as negative to a company’s culture.

This post makes my skin crawl. I completely disagree with this person’s opinion. This is a bias view on the fact that start-ups must hire such lone wolf coders to make their company a success. Of course, their success is measured by how much software the “10X” will produce for them, but based on how much difficulty they may be with other employees or perhaps their egotistical methods may do more harm than good? Why would you want someone to work for you that doesn’t like working with others?

The belief of companies needing to hire only those considered “10X programmers” leaves a lot to be said about the company itself. A company’s main goal is to see themselves thrive, to continue to exist with their idea that somehow outlives those other rivals by only hiring the best of the best in technology that know their craft. Of course, focusing primarily on what the developers can do leaves out the question if they are a good fit to working with others as well. It’s the developers I’ve known that aren’t considered “10X” that witness the flaws of these so called “shining devs”. Condescending and god-like arrogance makes them inadequate to work with others. “Brilliant jerks” are just as likely, if not more, to leave technical debt in their wake with the workload they do. 

It’s a typical scenario to accept a “young, white dude” to express such ridiculous behavior in an office setting. A woman wouldn’t get away with that type of behavior, considering we would be considered hard to work with just for debating with self-entitled developers. (I want to make clear that I don’t think all programmers that do display a high knowledge of their craft are arrogant, but it concerns me that even if they are, employers won’t always consider that’s a problem.)
