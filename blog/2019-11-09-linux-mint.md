[After installing lubuntu on my old computer](/first-experience-with-linux), I decided to install a popular Linux distro: Linux Mint. I heard that it's similar to the Windows layout and wanted to see for myself.

Unlike the previous post, you'll notice I was ready to document this. ðŸ˜‰

## Create the bootable USB

First thing I had to do was download the mirror from this [page](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=267). This was the first time I encountered mirrors and had no idea what they were. After looking at some forums, it seems my best bet was to just download the ISO file from the first of the 16 choices for USA mirrors. It took about 20 min for the file to download.

Iâ€™m still not entirely sure why they are called "mirrors".

The one I went with was from "advancedhosters.com".

## Verify the ISO file

This step was not something I did when installing lubuntu. Linux Mint strongly suggests checking to make sure the ISO downloaded has not been corrupted.

I created a folder called "ISO" and put the file in it.

Make sure to _right click and save the files_, I didn't read the instructions and had to do this step again.
