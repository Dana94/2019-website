Once I [installed Linux Mint](/installing-linux-mint), I tried to install 2 programs just to learn how it's done in Linux. I know it's not as easy as running an executable, so this is what that post is about.

I learned how to install programs 2 ways: through a package and a debian file.

## Installing Visual Studio Code


## Installing Blender


## Note:

In Linux Mint there is a handy way to install programs that I could've used but I took the harder route.
