This post has a small intro to what GraphQL is and how it can be used in the "playground" where you can query for data and test it out yourself. I also use [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) in the playground section since it's one of the first occurrences I had with the language and I remember being a bit confused on how to understand the schemas available. I struggled when I first tried to play with the API on my own, so I hope this could clarify the same confusion for someone else.

## In short: What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language that makes it easier to specify the data you need from the API you are calling. Unlike when you call REST APIs, you have to receive all the data instead of only what you want (we'll see this in action in the playground section).

You can only use GraphQL to query data from APIs that are _built_ to be used with GraphQL. This is because the data in these kinds of APIs are structured with types and fields.

## Playground

If you are using Gridsome, run your project with `yarn develop`. You will see 2 links for where the site is running at and for how to view the GraphQL playground to query your data.
