I've been meaning to write a post on CSS animations for a long time now. I am in no way an expert in the creating breath-taking animations made in code.

Yet.

And after the umpteenth time I had to visit the [animation section on MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation), I thought it would be a good idea to note all the things I've come to understand by now when making animations in CSS.

To start off, an element will be assigned the `animation` property.

One line can hold 8 values to creating an animation:

- duration
- timing
- delay
- how many times the animation runs
- direction
- fill-mode
- play-state
- name (could be created animation or a standard one - more on this later)

That's a lot packed into 1 CSS property. Let's look at each one in more detail.

### Duration

### Timing

### Delay

### Iteration

### Direction

### Fill-mode

### Play-state

### Name
