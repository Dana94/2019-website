### Direction

The direction the animation moves:

- forwards (once the animation is over, it remains where it finishes)
- reverse (same as forwards, only reversed)
- alternate
- alternate-reverse
- normal

### Fill-mode

Sets the animation style before and after it runs. I've never needed to use this setting myself.

### Play-state

Set if the animation is running or not.

- paused
- running

### Name

With an animation created using `keyframes`, you can use its name to set it as the element's animation.

I created an animation to gently rise and lower an element for a loading screen.
