Due to COVID-19, [CodeLand 2020](https://codelandconf.com/) was decided to be hosted online. The conference was for 2 days, one for talks and the other for workshops. The first day was free so I was able to attend the talks from some awesome people, from well-known in the dev community to first-time speakers new to the coding world.

I've been trying to embrace more online tech events due to being kept from traveling during this time. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from _another_ online conference. Each one has its similar features, talks with live chats where your messages often get lost in the stream of thousands of viewers with another part for "booths" for sponsors to introduce themselves and give away digital swag and the implied possibility of helping you get a job opportunity in their company. I found these setups to be impersonal and hard to follow. Most of the time I was trying to have sponsors open in one tab with the live stream in another, and it wasn't the sort of scheduled view of watching a speaker for 20 min and _then_ moving on to talk with other devs. Everything was squished together.

So, yeah, I didn't think I would be very impressed with CodeLand 2020's presentation. I was sorely mistaken.

DEV's platform was perfect with speakers having a blog post for their slides and recorded video to be reviewed and referred to for someone that couldn't stay on the live stream all day (like me).

I bookmarked everyone's talk and wanted to do what I did in last year's CodeLand 2019 post and give a brief description for each one.

## Being Utterly Fearless in Your Pursuit of Learning to Code with Alex Morton

- First time speaker
- Remote job in customer support in start-up
- After coding as a hobby 1.5 years before, she chose to learn program full-time

5 nuggets of wisdom:

1. Cultivate your why

When working in her job, she noticed there weren't really any women in these engineering teams and wondered "where are all the women?". Wanted to make herself more marketable. Unique to you - but connect to something bigger.

2. Err on the side of taking action

Reject perfectionism and take the next step

3. Dive in and identify your knowledge gaps

Trust your curiosity and move away from tutorials.

4.Be the creative director in your own life.

Pursue creative impulses and chase your mindset.

5. Play the long game and have fun.

Build systems and habits.

Embrace your unique journey.
