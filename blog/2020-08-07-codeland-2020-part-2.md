## You and Me Learn All About HTTP with Safia Abdalla

Safia goes over what HTTP is and the different web protocols that exist.

HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

HyperText - hyperlinks (links to tother images, etc on the web) with text.

Transfer - protocol relates in a way hypertext is exchanged between devices

Interactive option to follow along in dev tools to learn about HTTP exploration.

Use Network tab to see outgoing requests from the web browser or native app and responses from the server.

GET, POST - post info to web server, PUT, DELETE

different headers: type of resource transferred

HTTP pipelining is a feature where multiple requests can be sent at the same time to and their res can be processes separately instead of waiting for each to succeed one by one.

HTTPS secures transmission of hypertext documents.

Safia also introduces the network stack how all the protocols relate to the others.

HTTPs is TLS (how messages should be encrypted and using authentication - security) applied to HTTP (for transmitting messages) using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).

## Fighting Imposter Syndrome With IoT, with Tilde Thurium

Tilde is a developer evangelist at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) who was suggested to use positive affirmations by their therapist to handle imposter syndrome (?). This advice gave them the idea to create a project to automate sending positive affirmations using Node.js, Twilio Serverless Functions, and a [Flic button](https://flic.io/) which can be sed to send HTTP requests with one push.

Twilio is a cloud communications platform that's hosting the phone number shown in their editor so a viewer of the talk can test positive affirmations while the code is being run.

Serverless functions are useful to handle immediate deploys for small projects that require minimal coding - such as sending positive affirmations to yourself.

I have never seen such a short talk with someone coding live before (this whole presentation took abut 5 min) and in the end, Tilde did receive a message from someone after they pushed the Flic button.
