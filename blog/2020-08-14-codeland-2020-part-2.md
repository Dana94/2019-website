## What I learned from 6 years of building CodeNewbie with Saron Yitbarek

Saron is the founder of CodeNewbie and she talks about her experience building CodeNewbie.

Acquired by DEV 6 months ago, it's podcasts and meetups.

Goes over her coding journey in non-tech roles. Noticed engineers were the most valued in the company - she was interested in developing her skills in this field.

Tok some time to code on her own , then joined the FlatIron bootcamp. So expensive to experience this community when struggling, she wanted to crete her own that's free.

Started on Twitter to meet other coders and discuss what they are doing.

1. People need to feel safe and loved: There is a place for you in the tech industry.
2. It's not about a place, it's about a shared experience.
3. Rules recruit and filter: Being supportive and kind are required.
4. People are generally helpful, but it's up to you to ask for help.
5. The power of Twitter mentorship: Reach out to hel p others who are looking for a job, to better their skills, etc.
6. Stories are everything: Started CodeNewbie podcast for topics too big for Twitter - to focus on CodeNewbie journey, get to know the people behind the code.
7. Representation matters: Career tracks, backgrounds, don't have CS degrees.
8. To get out of the way: Saron pointed out how she rarely speaks in her podcast episodes in order to center the guest she's speaking with.
9. There's no one way to do it: No one way to become a developer.
10. Junior developers are assets: They force you to know what you are talking about, have good documentation, an collaborate and mentor others, have a lot to offer. I wish companies valued junior developers more that I see.
11. Consistency is powerful: 100 Days of Code Campaign to push someone to get into the habit of coding and making progress.
12. To capture the value you create.
13. Sustainability if important: Pushed Saron to make CodeNewbie full-time.
14. Accessibility is everywhere: Blind listener appreciated learning from a podcast (baseCS) since most learning resources are visual based.
15. Feedback is love: Someone trusts that you care enough to do this thing, these thoughts.
16. Small, consistent acts build trust.
17. Application > tooling: It's important to know what the tech is being sed for, rather than how it's make.
18. Everyone's a newbie: We're always learning something new to challenge us.

Saron also spoke to us about her mental health journey while working on CodeNewbie.

19. Drugs are great.
20. Mental health is self care.

## Live Exploiting Your Open Source Dependencies with Brian Vermeer

Brian speaks about he importance of security in open source software and introducing DevSecOps.

DevSecOps ensures security is a part of software delivery process and not as a last-minute thought and compromises customer security.

Brian talks abut the underlying problem of taking care to ship you code with dependencies built by other developers and companies and how to make sure it doesn't compromise our product.

He showed a live hack to exploit his example to do applications during the talk.

Solution:

Team culture - to allow time to work on security, not just new features

Process - Adapt process to work in production as needed.

Tooling - Using Brian's company to test dependencies locally and include DevSecOps in development process.

## Printing floating point numbers with Gargi Sharma

Gargi talks about how printing floating point numbers harder then one might expect.

She discussed different algorithms (all have dragon-related names related to the [Dragon Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve)) used to define floating point numbers through binary.

- information preservation
- minimum length
- correctly routed
- left to right generation

There are still new algorithms being made to work on this issue.

## To Kill a Working Drone: Flying drones with Twitter, Bananas and WebAPIs with Lucky Nkosi

Lucky bought himself a drone one night and realizing he didn't need one, decided to hack it.

He depended on mobile browsers in his talk since it's realistically how those in Africa would access access the internet offline. (?)

The drone can be controlled with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth low energy. He chose to use Bluetooth low energy - a form of wireless communication designed expecting for short range communication.

Use Web APIs to access (pjone movements?)

By turning his phone would dictate which direction the drone moves. Lucky decided to take it a step farther and use a device called LEAP Motion Sensor to model his hands in a kind of VR experience to stimulate the phone's direction use.

He's interested in human computer interaction. He like coming up with whats considered "ridiculous" things because he's learning along the way wile he's playing.

## You and Me Learn All About HTTP with Safia Abdalla

Safia goes over what HTTP is and the different web protocols that exist.

HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

HyperText - hyperlinks (links to tother images, etc on the web) with text.

Transfer - protocol relates in a way hypertext is exchanged between devices

Interactive option to follow along in dev tools to learn about HTTP exploration.

Use Network tab to see outgoing requests from the web browser or native app and responses from the server.

GET, POST - post info to web server, PUT, DELETE

different headers: type of resource transferred

HTTP pipelining is a feature where multiple requests can be sent at the same time to and their res can be processes separately instead of waiting for each to succeed one by one.

HTTPS secures transmission of hypertext documents.

Safia also introduces the network stack how all the protocols relate to the others.

HTTPs is TLS (how messages should be encrypted and using authentication - security) applied to HTTP (for transmitting messages) using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).

## Fighting Imposter Syndrome With IoT, with Tilde Thurium

Tilde is a developer evangelist at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) who was suggested to use positive affirmations by their therapist to handle imposter syndrome (?). This advice gave them the idea to create a project to automate sending positive affirmations using Node.js, Twilio Serverless Functions, and a [Flic button](https://flic.io/) which can be sed to send HTTP requests with one push.

Twilio is a cloud communications platform that's hosting the phone number shown in their editor so a viewer of the talk can test positive affirmations while the code is being run.

Serverless functions are useful to handle immediate deploys for small projects that require minimal coding - such as sending positive affirmations to yourself.

I have never seen such a short talk with someone coding live before (this whole presentation took abut 5 min) and in the end, Tilde did receive a message from someone after they pushed the Flic button.

## Accessibility Matters: How to Build Apps for Everyone with Miranda Limonczenko

Miranda shares her experience of building a website and her tips to including accessibility in your own projects.

It's important to give software little restriction from someone sing a product or applying to a job because of ny disability they may possess.

She built a site for Guide Dogs for the Blind which required a good experience for thsoe who are visually impared or cannot see at all.

There were 2 user groups

- visually impaired which consisted of (but not limited to) color contrast, hover states, and options to adjust text size and contrast.
- blind needed organized menu structure, clear elements to give information anf images to to give a better experience given to them by screenreader software.

Hover states more than just color change

screen reader gives info on the menu architecture so the main dy may be skipped anyway.

## Emoji Encoding, Unicode, and Internationalization with Naomi Meyer

Naomi goes over the underlying information about emojis and unicode.

Emojis have more users than any other language or character set on Earth.

I18n - internationalization, preparing an app or a website with translations wrap in I18N object for globalization.

Encoding - interpreted as 0's and 1's. ASCII - American Standard Code For Information Interchange, Internet broke computers when they each had their own languages, dialects so a different independent encoding system on a user's computer. 2 different encoding systems couldn't wrk together so it roke things.

Unicode - like a phone book to receive a letter, ensure not collisions of different language alphabets
UTF-8 (Unicode transformation Format - popular open source algorithm (UTF)) => character encoding translation system changes unicode to physical bits (1 and 0)
UTF-8 is the most common on the web, it's important to use so anyone can enter a name with their proper accents if needed.

Emoji - Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ) to attach different emoji code points together, skin tone modifier based off a dermatology scale based on UV light exposure. SHows how some emojis like 👩‍🎤emoji are created by combing other emojis and ZWJ to get its length of 7.

Emojis can be proposed, non-binary, head-scarf, non-binary mer-person.

[You can propose emojis on the Unicode site](http://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html).

Shows a lot of enthusiasm.
