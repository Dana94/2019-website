I was once asked to explain what closure is in a technical interview and I think I messed it up to say the least. I have an understanding of the concept, but couldn't put it into my own words how to define it.

It's best to describe it in terms of how functions are expected to work in programming. A function is used to carry out some logic or rules only run when the function is called elsewhere in the program. No matter how many times the program is expected to be used, each instance is self contained.

```js
function double(num) {
  num += num; //8
  return function square() {
    return num**2; //64
  }
}

let total = double(4);
console.log(total()) //64
```
