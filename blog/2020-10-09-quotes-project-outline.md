I was collecting a bunch of quotes in a Google spreadsheet and wanted to display them in a project. I was also learning GraphQL, so I wanted to make my own API to query them into a Vue.js project.

## Design & Colors

I knew I wanted to implement a light and dark mode to switch between.

I came up with the "pastel rainbow" colors for the "light" mode.

Along with a neon color scheme for the "dark" mode.

While there were quite a few icons I used from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/), the quotation symbols were created by me using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). I had to create a pair of open and closed quotes for every single color in both schemes.
